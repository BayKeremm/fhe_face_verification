# Thesis Repository - Kerem Okyay
Welcome to this repository. Here, I will provide the code developed during 2024-2025 for my thesis. 

Directories:
- `facenet`: Explains  how to produce the 512-dimensional FaceNet embeddings using CECI clusters.
- `communication_scenario`: The implementation of the communication scenario explained in Chapter 3.
- `experiments`: The code for experiments described in Chapter 5. Requires FaceNet pair embeddings.
